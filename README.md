Match 2048
=========

Think of this game as 2048 + Matching Cards Combined. 
I thought it'd be a fun app to hack at while trying to learn iOS.
*I don't have an iOS Developer Account so I don't have an iTunes link to provide.

HOW TO PLAY: Click on any two tiles. 
If the two tiles match, the first tile will double in value and the other will revert to a "2".
Game ends when you want it to.

SCORE: Adds any doubled tiles and subtracts any mismatched tile.
